# POST requests

A POST request is used when we, as a user, want to send data to the server for them to use. For example, you send a GET request to Facebook initially and it brings you to a login page. From there you fill out the form with your username and password and then hit enter. Your browser then sends a POST request with your username and password data for the server to use to authenticate you. A POST request will also return HTML data for you. 

Think of a POST request as POSTing data to the website.
