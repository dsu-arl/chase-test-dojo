# POST requests

A POST request is one of the most commonly used HTTP methods for sending data to a server. Instead of asking for information (as in a GET request), a POST request sends data to the server to be processed. This is typically used when you submit a form on a website, such as logging in, creating a new account, or posting a comment. For instance, when you fill in your details and hit "Sign Up" on a website, your browser sends a POST request to the server with all your information.

Think of a POST request as saying, "Hereâ€™s some data; please handle it." The server receives the data, processes it (maybe saves it in a database), and often sends back a response to confirm that the data was received successfully or to give you more information.
